# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Finding trends and analyses via Kickstarter data.
## Overview of Project
The goals of this project were to break down the data from fundraiser campaigns to find trends as to what criteria helps create a successful and profitable fundraiser. To find this information numerous pivot tables, virous charts, and filters were used isloate certain sections of data and provide the necessary information. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to discover what trends leads to a successful and profitable fundraiser, as well as what causes a fundraiser to flop and lose money. By finding both trends we can then plan fundraisers to follow the successful trends and continue to flourish year round. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The image above shows that during the summer months, fundraisers are more succesful. In the winter months or as the weather starts to become colder the fundraisers. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This image depicts a helix like pattern in which when goals are that of 1000 or less the are the most successful at approximately 78%. Afterwards it tends to falter down to around 20% at $25,000-$29,999. Then it proceeds to make its way upward to 70% successful at goals based around $35,000-$44,999. The best rate of success is when goals are between $0-$9,999 as well as $30,000-$44,999. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The hardest aspects of the assessment was slowing down and double checking the work. When dealing with such a large set of data, minor mistakes tend to cause significant changes to outcomes. One specific challenge was on the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet. Instead of manually inserting greater than and less than criteria in the formula, I decided it was best to created a small chart that followed the +5,000 trend and use the fill handle to go down the list. Then have the ability to reference the cells. After some trial and error I was successful. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes-based on Launch Date?
We can conclude that as the warmer months come into the picture more people are willing to go out and support fundraisers causing the success rates to go up. Another conclusion we can make is that during the colder months less people are willing to go out and support these types of fundraisers. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes-based on Goals?
There are little pockets of success as shown from the line chart at #13. These success ranges come from goals less then $4,999 and between $35,000 and $44,999. Having low goals are much more reasonable then those extravagent high goals.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset lacks feedback from those that ran it and attended the event. Not having a rating system for enjoyment creates a lack of more comparable data. For more specified data we would want to see how far over the goal successful fundraisers made and visa versa for how much money was lost for failure fundraisers.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could be comparing success rates with the amount of backers each fundraiser had. Another graph we could get is the outcome of fundraisers being compared to whether they are in the spotlight or not. These two analyses would provide meaningful information for trends and future successes.
